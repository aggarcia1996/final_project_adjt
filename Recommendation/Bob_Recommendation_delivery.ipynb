    "During the analysis phase, one of the points that was highlighted is that there is a problem with the engagement of the current client base. This can be seen in the average amount of products per client on a given month, which right now is below one, meaning that there are more customers without products than with products, while at the very least this ratio should be at one. This found issue aligns with the overall current strategy of the company, which is to reorient the commercial focus towards increasing the penetration of the product portfolio in the existing client base to increase profits rather than doing any other campaign for acquiring new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this in mind, in order to recommend products to the current clientbase to maximize profitability out of it, there are several strategies to follow: one could be to place the focus on customers that have no products or customers that have one product. Another strategy could be to offer different products to our best clients. From a business point of view seems logic to make an effort on focusing on clients that have zero or one product, this would lead to an increase of the engagement of a very inactive client base which has larger potential benefit, not only in terms of customers that can be targetted but also for long term prospects. Prior to jump into fancy Machine Learning models, sa attempt should be made at manually characterize these customers and understand which products to offer them, as relevant information is already available from the analysis phase. Once this manual approach has been understood, it can be constrasted with results from a Machine Learning model that would yield probabilities of purchase for this manually chosen customers. This would set the ground for future improvement, tuning and scale up of models that can help the company to become Data driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "This module will focus on the practical implementation of some of the aforemetioned ideas: manual selection of customers having the target of the company in mind, evaluation of the probabilities of these chosen customers to actually purchase the offered product together with the confidence interval associated to this probabilities and finally, the limitations of the model and possible steps towards the future. As a reminder: the Marketing department stated that the current budget allows only 10k mails to be sent, so the goal will be to maximize the potential revenue that can be gained out of them."

The idea behind is that to re-engage these customers and enlarge the proportion of active customers within the current clientbase of the company would be more benefitial than exploiting current active customers with already several products.\n",

Thus, the first step is the manual selection of the 10k customers that will receive a mail with a recommended product, followed by the, again manual, selection of the product to be offered. \n",

The model will be designed as a Supervised Learning problem, trained with the data provided by the IT department and used to assess the purchase likelihood of the selected customers.

    "Even though during the analysis it could be seen that there are concerns on how the \"active_customer\" feature is computed, it will still be used as an indicator of recent engagement with the company. In order to select the 10k customers, the first filter will be to check whether they have been active or not in the company application during the last partition of data, as it is believed that hey will be more likely to purchase a product than customers that have not been active. If in the future, the way of computing this feature is readjusted and improved, it will only have a beneficial impact on this approach.\n",

    "The selection of final customers will be based on the following features: total revenue and months of activity. From the available data, which includes demographics, products owned and commercial activity, the overall revenue that a client has brought to Easy Money over its time as a client could be taken as a positive indicator of engagement and predisposition of re-engaging. In a similar fashion, from the commercial information, the total month of activity in the company's application can be used as a positive indicator of engagement.\n",

In order to add one more dimension to the data from where to draw patterns, age will be added as additional information, it is chosen because it seems the most reliable feature out of the ones available.

The former would mean that we are not identifying as a buyer someone with higher chances of being so. False positives are also important because they would be targetted as buyers when they won't likely buy anything, but as long as the number of False Negatives is reduced to a minimum, a low proportion of False Negatives is not concerning. In order to evaluate this properly, the target metrics will be recall and accuracy.\n",

As it can be seen, our accuracy is much better than this, for both Training and Testing (93.6% and 93.2% respectively).
